# ðŸŽ¨ Parallel Screensaver with OpenMP

## ðŸŒŸ Objectives and Competencies
- **Implement and design** a program for parallelizing processes using shared memory with **OpenMP**.
- **Apply the PCAM method** and concepts of decomposition and programming patterns to modify a sequential program and make it parallel.
- **Iteratively improve** and modify the program to achieve better versions.

## ðŸ’» Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a **parallelized screensaver** that draws graphics on the screen using **OpenMP** for process parallelization. The main goals are to maintain a smooth frame rate (ideally **60 FPS or more**) while generating **N elements** in parallel, demonstrating the potential performance improvements over a sequential approach.

### ðŸ“š Libraries and Tools
-**OpenGL**

### ðŸ§ª Performance Testing
To measure the program's performance, the execution time for generating **N elements** without dropping frames per second is calculated. We tested various values of **N** to showcase the improvements achieved through parallelization.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install the necessary libraries** (e.g., SDL, OpenGL).
